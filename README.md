# C and C++ Journey

Welcome to the learning adventure in mastering C and C++ for embedded programming! 

### What’s Inside?
- **Phase 1: Foundations of C + Basic DSA** - Mastering C syntax, pointers, and essentials like arrays, linked lists, and stacks through simple software projects.
- **Phase 2: Transition to C++ + Intermediate DSA** - Exploring C++ with OOP, vectors, queues, and binary trees via more complex software builds.
- **Phase 3: Embedded Programming + Advanced DSA** - Applying C/C++ to Arduino hardware, integrating bit manipulation, circular queues, and BSTs in real-world projects.
- **Phase 4: Combining Everything** - Tying it all together with multi-concept embedded projects like data loggers and motor controllers.
