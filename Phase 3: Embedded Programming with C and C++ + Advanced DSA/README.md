# Phase 3: Embedded Programming with C/C++ + Advanced DSA (8-10 Weeks)

## Overview
Shift to embedded programming using Arduino, integrating C/C++ with advanced DSA. Projects use hardware for practical experience.

## Objectives
- Learn embedded basics (GPIO, PWM, interrupts).
- Apply DSA in resource-constrained environments.
- Complete 10+ hardware projects.

## Concepts and DSA
| Week | Embedded Concepts    | Data Structure         | Algorithm           |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 1-2  | GPIO, bit operations | None                   | Bitwise AND/OR/Shift |
| 3-4  | Analog/digital input | Circular Queue         | Enqueue, Dequeue (circular) |
| 5-6  | PWM                  | Stack (linked-list)    | Push, Pop           |
| 7-8  | UART (Serial)        | Priority Queue (array) | Insert, Extract-Max |
| 9-10 | Interrupts           | Binary Search Tree     | Insertion, Search   |

## Projects
1. **LED Blinker** (Week 1): Blink LED every second.
2. **Button Toggle** (Week 2): Bit flags to toggle LED with button.
3. **Light Meter** (Week 3): Read photoresistor value.
4. **Average Readings** (Week 4): Circular queue for 5 sensor averages.
5. **Fading LED** (Week 5): PWM to fade LED.
6. **Brightness History** (Week 6): Stack for 5 brightness levels.
7. **Echo Server** (Week 7): Echo text via Serial.
8. **Data Buffer** (Week 8): Priority queue for 5 sensor values.
9. **Button Counter** (Week 9): Interrupt to count presses.
10. **Threshold Tree** (Week 10): BST for sensor thresholds.

## Hardware
- **Arduino Uno** (~$20).
- **Components**: LEDs, button, photoresistor, resistors (~$10 kit).

## Resources
- **Books**: "Programming Embedded Systems in C and C++" by Michael Barr.
- **Online**: Arduino.cc, GeeksforGeeks (Priority Queue, BST).
- **Tools**: Arduino IDE.

## Tips
- Test DSA on PC before Arduino (memory limits apply).
- Breadboard circuits simplyâ€”start with one component.
