# Phase 2: Transition to C++ + Intermediate DSA (6-8 Weeks)

## Overview
This phase transitions you from C to C++ with object-oriented programming (OOP) and introduces intermediate DSA. Projects remain simple and software-focused.

## Objectives
- Understand C++ syntax and OOP.
- Apply intermediate DSA in C++.
- Complete 10+ projects.

## Concepts and DSA
| Week | C++ Concepts           | Data Structure       | Algorithm           |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | Classes, objects, I/O  | Arrays (C++ style)   | Linear Search       |
| 2-3  | new/delete, STL vectors| Dynamic Arrays (vectors) | Binary Search   |
| 4-5  | Inheritance, polymorphism | Queue (array-based) | Enqueue, Dequeue, Front |
| 6-7  | Templates              | Binary Tree          | Inorder Traversal, Insertion |

## Projects
1. **Bank Account** (Week 1): Class to manage balance, search transactions.
2. **Greeting Generator** (Week 1): Array of names, linear search.
3. **Dynamic List** (Week 2): Vector to add/remove numbers.
4. **Number Finder** (Week 3): Binary search in sorted vector.
5. **Shape Drawer** (Week 4): Inherited Circle/Rectangle classes.
6. **Ticket Queue** (Week 5): Queue for 5 ticket numbers.
7. **Generic Max** (Week 6): Template function for int/float max.
8. **Family Tree** (Week 7): Binary tree for 5 names, inorder traversal.

## Resources
- **Books**: "C++ Primer" by Lippman et al.
- **Online**: LearnCpp.com, GeeksforGeeks (Binary Search, Queues, Trees).
- **Tools**: GCC or Visual Studio Community.

## Tips
- Compare C and C++ versions of similar projects (e.g., arrays vs. vectors).
- Test DSA logic with small datasets first.
