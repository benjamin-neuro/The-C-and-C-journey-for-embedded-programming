# Phase 1: Foundations of C + Basic DSA (6-8 Weeks)

## Overview
This phase introduces you to C programming and foundational data structures and algorithms (DSA). You'll build simple software projects to solidify your skills, preparing for embedded programming. Assumes basic Python experience.

## Objectives
- Master C syntax and core concepts.
- Learn basic DSA with practical applications.
- Complete 10+ small projects.

## Concepts and DSA
| Week | C Concepts                | Data Structure       | Algorithm           |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | Syntax, variables, I/O    | None                 | None                |
| 2    | If-else, loops, switch    | Static Arrays        | Linear Search       |
| 3    | Functions, scope          | Arrays               | Bubble Sort         |
| 4-5  | Pointers, dynamic memory  | Singly Linked List   | Insertion, Traversal, Deletion |
| 6-7  | Structs, typedef          | Stack (array-based)  | Push, Pop, Peek     |

## Projects
1. **Number Guesser** (Week 1): Guess a hardcoded number using I/O.
2. **Unit Converter** (Week 1): Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. **Odd/Even Checker** (Week 2): Array of 1-10, print odd/even.
4. **Simple Menu** (Week 2): Linear search in array of options.
5. **Max Finder** (Week 3): Function to find max in array.
6. **Array Sorter** (Week 3): Bubble sort 5 numbers.
7. **Swap Numbers** (Week 4): Swap two variables with pointers.
8. **To-Do List** (Week 5): Linked list for 3 tasks (add/traverse/delete).
9. **Student Record** (Week 6): Struct array for 3 students.
10. **Bracket Checker** (Week 7): Stack to check balanced parentheses.

## Resources
- **Books**: "C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide," K&R "The C Programming Language."
- **Online**: Learn-C.org, GeeksforGeeks (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack).
- **Tools**: GCC or Code::Blocks.

## Tips
- Compile and run each project to debug errors.
- Start with small code snippets before full projects.
